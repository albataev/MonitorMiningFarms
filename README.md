# MonitorMiningFarms

Simple mining farm monitor.

Connects via SSH, so all the data is absolutely secure

It can:
- watch your miner software on each mining rig and get its parameters, such as hashrate, uptime, temperature, etc - whatever data mining software can provide
- get host machine (mining rig itself) data
- reboot stuck miners
- hard reset (if such hardware presented). Here code is adapted for usage of Network Controlling AC\DC relay

Data saved locally in the simple html\text format.

Planned works - to add fully functional web interface.
